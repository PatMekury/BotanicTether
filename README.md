# Botanic Tether: An augmented reality app that leverages Niantic Lightship Ops to anchor virtual objects in the real world. Explore the Houston Arboretum and Natural Center, discover hidden information about the flora, and immerse yourself in a unique botanical experience.

# This project aims to educate the public about the ecosystem of the natural centre and the efforts to achieve biodiversity conservation, highlighting how individuals can contribute to environmental sustainability.

# Key features include:
1. Lightship VPS for Location Services: Seamlessly integrates with Niantic’s Lightship platform, allowing precise positioning of virtual content in the physical environment.
2. Inworld Studio for AI Characters: Utilizes Inward Studio to create lifelike AI characters that communicate with Users through a voice Chat to learn about the environment.

# Developed using Unity 3D, the app is optimized for Apple iOS devices. After building in Unity, it’s transferred to Xcode for iPhone deployment.
